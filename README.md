# Guess-Game

I started coding about 2 years ago, but i wasn't familiar with github so i didn't have a good resume to show to companies.
so from today i started creating repos from everything i had done.

This is a simple guess game that i had wrote those days.
it is simple but i realy enjoyed writing it.
